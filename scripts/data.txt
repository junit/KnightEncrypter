A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed, otherwise it is open.
Myotis escalerai is a European bat, found in Spain (including the Balearic Islands), Portugal, and far southern France. Although the species was first named in 1904, it was included in the Natterer's bat species (Myotis nattereri) until molecular studies in 2006 proved that the two are distinct. Similar to M. nattereri, it is mostly gray with lighter underparts, and of medium size, less than 9.5 g (0.3 oz). It has a pointed muzzle, a pink face, and long ears. The bat is an agile flyer, with rapid wingbeats and broad wings, 245 to 300 mm (9.6 to 11.8 in). Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies in caves, mines, tree holes, bridges or houses. Hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between 0 and 5 °C (32 and 41 °F), and are usually found in caves or basements. The species was first seen in France in 2009, and it is classified as vulnerable in Portugal and Aragon. (Full article...)

The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students.[1] Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 × 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.
