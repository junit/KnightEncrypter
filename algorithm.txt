The Knight Encrypter uses the following algorithm.

Given a list of knight tour sequences in a chessboard and a text file:
Split the file text into segments, each of length 'l', where l = len(tour_sequence)
Rearrange the letters of each segment based on the numbers in a random sequence from the list of tours, specifically:
	encrypted_segment[i] = input_text[sequence[i]]
Then concatenate all the encrypted_segments and store in the output file along with the index of the random sequence in the list of tours. 
The password to decrypt the file is also encrypted and stored in the last line. 

A simple reverse process of the above results in the decrypted file.
